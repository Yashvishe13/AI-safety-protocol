No employees are present, resulting in zero count for various metrics.\n\n# KEY FINDINGS\n1. No employees are present in the database.\n2. All queries related to employee demographics and department information returned zero results.\n3. Average salary and employee count by department could not be calculated due to the absence of data.\n\n# STATISTICAL SUMMARY\n- Average salary by department: Not applicable (all results were zero)\n- Employee count by department: Not applicable (all results were zero)\n- Top 5 departments with the highest average salary: Not applicable (all results were zero)\n\n# DATA QUALITY\nData Quality Score: 0/100. Issues found: 0 (no data present)\n\n# RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Populate the employees table with relevant data to enable analysis.\n2. Review database schema to ensure it is aligned with organizational needs.\n3. Develop a data ingestion process to regularly update employee information.\n\n# CONCLUSION\nThe analysis of employee demographics and department information was hindered by the absence of data in the database. To move forward with analysis, it is essential to populate the employees table with relevant data and develop a data ingestion process to ensure the database remains up-to-date.",
